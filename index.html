    <p><b>Proposal: Stabilizing Employee Work Hours</b></p>
    <p>
        This proposal recommends reallocating the company's funds and resources to ensure employees receive consistent and sustainable hours.
        Providing a stable work schedule will improve employees financial security, morale, and companies performance.
        Following the COVID-19 pandemic, many companies reduced employee hours. While conditions improved, employees continued to experience an inconsistent working schedule
        The company should reevaluate unnecessary expenditures and reallocate funds towards stabilizing employees work hours.
        Areas for potential reallocation could be excessive bonuses, short lived concepts, or underperforming contracts.
        Investing in employees through stable scheduling is not only responsible but also beneficial.
        Workforce stability strenghens the company performance and community trust.

        Subject: 	Review of Employee Work Hour Stability<br>

        <p>
            Over the past few years, leadership has received feedback regarding inconsistent work hours across multiple departments.
            We recognize that scheduling instability affects employees financial security and well-being.
            As a result of this, leadership will be conducting a comprehensive review of the company expenditures and will be planning to identify
            opportunities to provide a more consistent scheduling.
            Employees are highly encouraged to submit feedback. Further updates will be shared once a plan has been finalized.
            We appreciate your dedication and commitment to VAMCo.

        Subject: Data request for Employee Work Hour Stability<br>
        <p>Good Afternoon,</p>
        <p>
            I am reaching out regarding reports of inconsistent work hours affecting employees all across VAMCo.
            This issue has created financial challenges and employee dissatisfaction.
            Could you please provide data on factors that contribute to these labor and scheduling issues?
            Any information will help us develop strategies to improve work and scheduling stability for the company.
        </p>
        <p>Thank you for your time and assistance.</p>

        Since the COVID-19 pandemic, many employees at VAMCo have been dealing with unstable hours, which has caused financial stress and frustration.
        I think it's really important we fix this because our employees play a key role in the company's success.
        My solution would be to cut back on expenses that don't really help the company, like unnecessary POS updates or unreliable third-party services, and use those funds and resources to give our employees stable hours.
        Doing this will help our employees feel more financially secure and improve morale while making the company stronger overall.
