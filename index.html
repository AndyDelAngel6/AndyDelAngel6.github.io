    <h1>Andy Del Angel</h1>
    <p>Hello, I am a student at Florida International University. I am working towards achieving my bachelors degree in computer science.<br>
    Some experiences that I have gained throughout my career (military and previous work experiences) has been working as a team, discipline and computer coding.<br>
    I hope to learn more things and gain more experience throughout my career, and my time in school.</p>
    
    <p>Proposal to provide employees in majority, if not all jobs enough working hours to meet their financial needs.</p>
    <p>After the COVID-19 pandemic, most if not everyone was affected by it. Most companies had to cut employees hours or even let them go from the company<br>
        This caused a lot of financial issues for people since they weren't provided sustainable hours to meet their financial needs.<br>
        This proposal recommends that since COVID-19 isn't a big issue now, companies such as VAMCo should reallocate their funds to provide employees with sustainable working hours<br>
        to help them meet their financial needs.
