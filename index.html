    <h1>Andy Del Angel</h1>
    <p>Hello, I am a student at Florida International University. I am working towards achieving my bachelors degree in computer science.<br>
    Some experiences that I have gained throughout my career (military and previous work experiences) has been working as a team, discipline and computer coding.<br>
    I hope to learn more things and gain more experience throughout my career, and my time in school.</p>
    
    <p>**Proposal to provide employees in majority, if not all jobs enough working hours to meet their financial needs.**</p>
    <p>After the COVID-19 pandemic, most if not everyone was affected by it. Most companies had to cut employees hours or even let them go from the company.<br>
        This caused a lot of financial issues for people since they weren't provided sustainable hours to meet their financial needs.<br>
        This proposal recommends that since COVID-19 isn't really a big issue now, companies should reallocate their funds to provide employees with sustainable working hours<br>
        to help them meet their financial needs.</p>
    <p>Reallocation of company funds from something that doesn't benefit the company such as high bonuses awards or short lived concepts<br>
        to benefit the employees that help the company grow</p>

    <p>**MEMORANDUM**
To: 		All VAMCo (Best Buy) employees
From:		VAMCo CEO
Date:		February 11th, 2026
Subject: 	Work Hours

Throughout the year we have heard many complaints from employees all over the world that VAMCo as a company hasn’t been giving them a stable number of hours to stabilize their financial needs. We have also looked closely into our community through webpages where they can interact and it seems like the same issues have occurred throughout. We will try to find a solution to the issue, so please give us some time to find that said solution.
Thank you for your commitment to working at VAMCo.

There’s been an issue that has been arising since the COVID-19 pandemic that has affected many companies, including VAMCo. This is issue is job instability, many employees have complained about unstable work hours and how it is affecting them financially. It is with upmost importance that we find a solution to this issue because all our employees are valuable assets to the company. The solution I propose is to cutback on expenses that don’t benefit the company and invest it into our employees, some examples of these could be cutting back on pointless POS updates, or untrustful third-party delivery methods. And these are just a few, but it is an issue that requires an immediate solution.
