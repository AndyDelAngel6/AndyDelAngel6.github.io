    <p>Proposal: Stabilizing Employee Work Hours</p>
    <p>This proposal recommeds reallocating the companies funds and resources to ensure employees receive consistent and sustainable hours.<br>
        Providing a stable work schedule will improve employees financial security, moral, and companies performance.</p>
    <p>Following the COVID-19 pandemic, many companies redcuded employee hours. While conditions improved, employees continued to experience an inconsistent working schedule</p>
    <p>The company should reevaluate unecessary expenditures and reallocate funds towards stabilizing employees work hours.<br>
        Areas for potential reallocation could be excessive bonus, short lived concepts, or underperforming contracts.</p>
    <p>Investing in employees through stable scheduling is not only responsible but also beneficial.<br>
        Work force stability strenghens the company performance and community trust.</p>

        Over the past few years, leadership has received feedback regarding inconsistent work hours across multiple departments.<br>
        We recognize that scheduling instability affects employees financial security and well being.<br>
        As a result of this, leadership will be conduction a comprehensive review of the company expenditures and will be planning to identify<br>
        opportunities to provide a more consistent scheduling.<br>
